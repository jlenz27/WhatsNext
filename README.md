# Whats Next
By John Lenz

## Description

A Website that allows a user to login and store multiple places that they want to visit and check them off as they go. It uses google maps api to allow the user to see what is close to them at a given time.

### `Time Log`
#### Friday, 28 April 2023
* 8am: set up project, lay out key areas of research
* 9am: Still researching ways to add API's
* 10am: Watching different tutorials on using google api
* 12pm: Finsished up tutorials on google API's
* 1pm: Working on setting up FireBase with React
* 2pm: Initial project setup
* 3:30pm: Have Google API Working in project



## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* Working Map
* Login ability
* Firebase

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
*React
*Google API
*Rapid API
*Yelp Fusion API
*Material UI


## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
*Adapt to mobile with react native
*styling

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
*React Native

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?




### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
